# Send-mail-From-localHost
Send Email with PHP & Gmail | Send Mail from Localhost using XAMPP Server.

Generally, in this program, on the webpage, there is a mail send the form with three inputs – email address, subject, and message. When you click on the send button without filling the form completely, there is a display of an alert labeled as  “All input fields are required!”. And when you filled up all inputs and click on the send button, your mail will be sent to a particular email address that you’ve provided in the recipient field and there is also display a success message labeled as “Your mail sent successfully to someone email”.

If somehow mail can’t be sent, there is a display of an alert labeled as “Sorry, failed while sending mail!”.
 I used SMTP Server to send Mail/Email from Localhost using XAMPP. An SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server is an application that’s main purpose is to send and receive mail/email between email senders and receivers.
